# Deploy Next.js to GitHub Pages

This is a Next.js template which can be deployed to GitHub Pages as a static site.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1.  Create a new public GitHub repository
2.  Push the starter code to the `main` branch
3.  On GitHub, go to **Settings** > **Pages** > **Source**, and choose **GitHub Actions** as the source
4.  Make a commit and push it to see the changes on GitHub Pages

Congratulations! You should have a URL like:

```bash
https://<github-user-name>.github.io/<github-project-name>/
```
